To Play:
	Two fully inflated balloons equals Hank's weight in buoyancy. Thus, three balloons need 
to be inflated in order for Hank to begin to fly. [SPACE] is used to fully inflate a single balloon which
costs ~5% of the Hydrogen tank. Each balloon has a slow leak and will eventually need to be refilled. To
inflate a balloon, [UP] is used. In order to avoid enemies, Hank is also able to deflate his balloons by 
using [DOWN].
